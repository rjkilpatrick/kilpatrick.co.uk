# About Me - John Kilpatrick

Hello there, I'm John Kilpatrick!
I'm an Optical Engineer with a background in physics, based in Belfast.

My PhD (2020 - 2024) was in physics using wavefront-shaping to image through optical fibres.
Publications can be found on my [Google Scholar](//scholar.google.com/citations?user=zciB3awAAAAJ).
I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2020 with a master's degree in Physics with study in New Zealand.

When I'm not working, you can find me walking along the Ulster way, or spending far too much on specialty coffee (currently, my favourite is [established](//established.coffee/)).

This year, I'm trying to learn chess (I'm not very good), and doing couch to 5k (this is here to hold myself accountable).

I'm also passionate about science outreach and connecting with others, so feel free to reach out and say hi!
I hope you find something interesting or useful here.
Feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if you have any questions or feedback.
